# Multipath TCP, defined in RFC6824, Assignment


Uses Nicolas Maitre's MPTCP-capable scapy impl, so that should be
on the python path, or run this from a directory containing that "scapy" dir

You can use the script "mptcp-launcher" to start scapy with the modified script. It
works only if you are in the same directory that the python "scapy" module.
